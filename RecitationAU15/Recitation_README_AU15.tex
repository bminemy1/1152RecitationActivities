\begin{itemize}
\item Do more warm-ups on the earlier recitation handouts. Some of the warm-ups are not on the master section files just the recitation handouts for this semester. 
\item Recitation 9 and 10: Both of these days were much too hard for the students. 
\item Recitation 11: Do a warm-up for a simple partial fraction decomposition.
\item Recitation 12: Problem 1: Can't have two solutions here.
\item Recitation 13: Problem 2 wording is weird. Also we can make problem 3 better by actually including more than just 1. Also perhaps we should include a graph of a direction field that depends on the horizontal variable. Problem 4: Include an example with a general solution like $y=4\pm \sqrt{x^3+C}$. 
\item Recitation 14: Problem 3b: Can not combine adjacent terms like this. e.g. $+1-1+1-1+1-1+\ldots$
\item Recitation 15: Warm-up. Include a limit of a sequence like $(1+b/n)^n$. Perhaps there is a better sequence to use in problem 2.
\item Recitation 16: In the future, it would be best to do question 3 (directly applying tests) rather than question 1 and 2.
\item Recitation 18: First, the warm-up is too difficult. Perhaps do an easy limit comparison test question on there. On Prob 2, put a root of a rational function here for limit comparison test. For 4b, perhaps try an easier summand. 
\item Recitation 19: For section 10.1, make more questions finding $p_k(x)$ and dealing with the remainder. Perhaps a question showing the graphs of $f(x)$, $p_1(x)$, $p_2(x)$ and so on.
